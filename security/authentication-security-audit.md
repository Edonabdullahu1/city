# Authentication & Authorization Security Audit Report

**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Auditor  
**Application:** City Break Travel Agency  
**Technology Stack:** Next.js 14+, NextAuth.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM  

## Executive Summary

**Overall Security Score: 72/100**

The travel agency application demonstrates a solid foundation for authentication and authorization with NextAuth.js implementation, proper password hashing, and role-based access control. However, several critical security gaps and vulnerabilities require immediate attention, particularly around session management, input validation, security logging, and protection against common attack vectors.

## Critical Security Findings

### üî¥ HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### 1. Information Disclosure in Authentication Logs
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `lib/auth.ts` lines 16-54, 68-93  
**Risk:** Sensitive authentication data logged to console

**Details:**
The authentication implementation contains extensive console logging that exposes sensitive information:
- User credentials validation attempts
- JWT token contents including user roles and IDs
- Session data including authentication states

**Impact:** 
- Production logs may contain sensitive user data
- Potential for credential harvesting from log files
- Compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS)

**Recommendation:**
Remove all `console.log()` statements from authentication flows or implement secure logging with data sanitization.

#### 2. Weak Password Policy
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` lines 13-17, `lib/services/authService.ts` lines 16-22  

**Current Policy:**
- Minimum 6 characters
- Requires: 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number
- No special character requirement
- No password history checking
- No password complexity scoring

**Vulnerabilities:**
- 6-character minimum is insufficient for 2025 standards
- Missing special character requirement allows weaker passwords
- No protection against common passwords
- No password reuse prevention

**Recommendation:**
Implement stronger password policy:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Require special characters
- Check against common password databases
- Implement password history tracking

#### 3. JWT Token Long Expiration
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `lib/auth.ts` line 64  

**Issue:** JWT tokens expire after 30 days, creating extended attack windows.

**Impact:**
- Compromised tokens remain valid for extended periods
- Increased risk of unauthorized access
- Difficulty revoking access for terminated users

**Recommendation:**
- Reduce JWT token expiration to 15 minutes
- Implement refresh token mechanism
- Add token revocation capabilities

### üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### 4. Missing Authentication Middleware
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `middleware.ts`  

**Issue:** The NextAuth middleware is completely disabled, leaving all routes unprotected at the middleware level.

**Impact:**
- No centralized route protection
- Individual API routes must handle authentication independently
- Inconsistent security implementation across the application

**Recommendation:**
Implement NextAuth middleware with proper route matching patterns.

#### 5. Inconsistent Authorization Checks
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** Multiple API routes  

**Issue:** Authorization checks are inconsistent across API routes:
- Some routes use direct role string comparison
- Others use helper functions
- Missing standardized authorization patterns

**Examples:**
- `app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts` line 11: Direct role comparison
- `app/api/agent/bookings/route.ts` line 10: Array includes check

**Recommendation:**
Standardize all authorization checks using the `withAuth` utility functions.

#### 6. Missing Rate Limiting
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** All authentication endpoints  

**Issue:** No rate limiting implemented on authentication endpoints.

**Impact:**
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Account enumeration attacks possible
- Denial of service potential

**Recommendation:**
Implement rate limiting on login, registration, and password change endpoints.

#### 7. Inadequate Session Security Configuration
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `lib/auth.ts`  

**Missing Security Configurations:**
- No secure cookie settings specified
- Missing sameSite cookie configuration
- No httpOnly enforcement validation
- No secure flag configuration for production

### üü¢ LOW SEVERITY FINDINGS

#### 8. Missing Security Headers
**Severity:** Low  
**Issue:** No security headers configured in Next.js configuration.

**Recommendation:**
Implement security headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.

#### 9. Error Message Information Leakage
**Severity:** Low  
**Location:** Various authentication endpoints  

**Issue:** Error messages may reveal whether email addresses exist in the system.

**Recommendation:**
Implement generic error messages for authentication failures.

## Security Strengths ‚úÖ

### Well-Implemented Security Measures

1. **Password Hashing:** Proper bcrypt implementation with salt rounds (12)
2. **SQL Injection Protection:** Prisma ORM provides parameterized queries
3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Comprehensive RBAC with USER/AGENT/ADMIN roles
4. **Input Validation:** Zod schema validation for registration and authentication
5. **Session Strategy:** JWT-based session management
6. **Authentication Service Layer:** Clean separation of concerns
7. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions

## Authentication Flow Analysis

### ‚úÖ Secure Implementation Areas

1. **Registration Flow:**
   - Input validation with Zod schemas
   - Email uniqueness checking
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Default role assignment

2. **Login Flow:**
   - Credential validation
   - Password verification with bcrypt
   - JWT token generation with user context

3. **Role Guard System:**
   - Comprehensive role-based protection utilities
   - Path-based access control functions
   - Proper redirect logic based on user roles

### ‚ùå Security Gaps

1. **No Email Verification:** Users can register without email verification
2. **No Account Lockout:** No protection against repeated failed login attempts
3. **No Password Reset:** Missing password reset functionality
4. **No Multi-Factor Authentication:** Single-factor authentication only

## API Security Assessment

### Protected Routes Analysis

**Properly Protected Routes:**
- `/api/user/profile` - Session-based auth ‚úÖ
- `/api/admin/bookings` - Role-based auth ‚úÖ
- `/api/agent/bookings` - Role-based auth ‚úÖ

**Security Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Standard pattern used across routes
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session?.user || session.user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

**Issues:**
- Manual session checking in every route
- Inconsistent error messages
- No centralized authorization logic

## Database Security Analysis

### User Model Security Review

**Secure Design Elements:**
- Password field properly separated in queries
- Role-based access with enum constraints
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Audit trail with BookingAudit relationship

**Potential Issues:**
- No password history tracking
- Missing login attempt logging
- No account lockout mechanism in schema

## Immediate Security Fixes Required

### Priority 1 (Critical - Fix Immediately)

1. **Remove Authentication Logging**
   ```typescript
   // Remove all console.log statements from lib/auth.ts
   // Implement secure logging with data sanitization
   ```

2. **Strengthen Password Policy**
   ```typescript

     .min(12, 'Password must be at least 12 characters')
     .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/, 
            'Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character');
   ```

3. **Implement Secure JWT Configuration**
   ```typescript
   session: {
     strategy: 'jwt',
     maxAge: 15 * 60, // 15 minutes
   },
   jwt: {
     maxAge: 15 * 60, // 15 minutes
   },
   cookies: {
     sessionToken: {
       name: 'next-auth.session-token',
       options: {
         httpOnly: true,
         sameSite: 'strict',
         path: '/',
         secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
       }
     }
   }
   ```
