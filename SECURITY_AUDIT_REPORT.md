## Critical Vulnerabilities (Risk: CRITICAL)

### 1. Missing Authentication Middleware on API Routes
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CWE:** CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)

**Issue:** Several API routes have authentication middleware temporarily removed or commented out, leaving sensitive endpoints unprotected.

**Affected Files:**
- `C:\git\city\app\api\bookings\soft-book\route.ts` - Line 67: "Authentication middleware temporarily removed"
- `C:\git\city\app\api\users\change-password\route.ts` - Line 65: "Authentication middleware temporarily removed"

**Impact:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive operations like creating bookings and changing passwords.

**Recommendation:** 
- Immediately restore authentication middleware on all protected routes
- Implement proper role-based authorization checks
- Add integration tests to verify authentication is working

### 2. Unprotected Webhook Endpoint
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CWE:** CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Issue:** WhatsApp webhook endpoint (`C:\git\city\app\api\webhooks\whatsapp\route.ts`) lacks authentication and request validation.

**Affected Code:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    // No authentication or signature verification
    const { event, messageId, status, phoneNumber, error } = body;
```

**Impact:** 
- Attackers can inject malicious webhook events
- Potential for data manipulation and unauthorized system access
- Information disclosure through webhook testing endpoint

**Recommendation:**
- Implement webhook signature verification using HMAC
- Add request rate limiting
- Remove or secure the GET endpoint used for testing

### 3. Insecure Cron Job Authorization
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CWE:** CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)

**Issue:** Cron job endpoint uses weak authorization mechanism that can be easily bypassed.

**Affected Code:** `C:\git\city\app\api\cron\expire-bookings\route.ts`
```typescript
if (cronSecret && authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

**Impact:** If CRON_SECRET is not set, the endpoint is completely unprotected, allowing unauthorized booking cancellations.

**Recommendation:**
- Make CRON_SECRET mandatory (fail-safe approach)
- Use stronger authentication mechanism
- Add IP allowlisting for cron jobs
- Implement request logging and monitoring

## High Vulnerabilities (Risk: HIGH)

### 4. Information Disclosure in Authentication Logs
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-532 (Information Exposure Through Log Files)

**Issue:** Sensitive information is logged during authentication process.

**Affected Code:** `C:\git\city\lib\auth.ts`
```typescript
console.log('JWT callback - token before:', token);
console.log('Session callback - session after:', session);
```

**Impact:** JWT tokens and user sessions logged in plaintext, potential credential exposure.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove or sanitize sensitive data from logs
- Implement proper logging levels (debug vs production)
- Use structured logging with data masking

### 5. Weak Password Requirements
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements)

**Issue:** Password policy is insufficient for a financial application handling payment data.

**Current Policy:**
- Minimum 6 characters

- No special characters required
- No maximum length limit

**Recommendation:**
- Increase minimum length to 12 characters
- Require special characters
- Implement password complexity scoring
- Add password history to prevent reuse
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts

### 6. Missing Rate Limiting
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits)

**Issue:** No rate limiting implemented on authentication endpoints or API routes.

**Impact:** 
- Brute force attacks on login endpoints
- API abuse and DoS attacks
- Resource exhaustion

**Recommendation:**
- Implement rate limiting on authentication routes (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Add general API rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP)
- Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting

### 7. Insecure File Upload Handling
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)

**Issue:** File upload validation is insufficient in `C:\git\city\app\api\upload\route.ts`.

**Problems:**
- Only checks MIME type (easily spoofed)
- No file content validation
- No antivirus scanning
- Files stored in public directory

**Recommendation:**
- Implement file signature verification
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store uploads outside web root
- Add file renaming to prevent path traversal
- Implement virus scanning integration

### 8. Missing CSRF Protection
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Issue:** State-changing operations lack CSRF protection.

**Impact:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE operations
- Use SameSite cookie attributes
- Verify Origin/Referer headers for sensitive operations

### 9. Inadequate Session Security
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without Secure Attribute)

**Issue:** JWT session configuration lacks security attributes.

**Current Configuration:**
```typescript
session: {
  strategy: 'jwt',
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days - too long
}
```

**Recommendation:**
- Reduce session duration to 4-8 hours
- Implement secure cookie attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Add session rotation on privilege escalation
- Implement concurrent session limits

### 10. Insufficient Input Validation
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)

**Issue:** Some API endpoints lack comprehensive input validation beyond Zod schemas.

**Example:** Email addresses not properly sanitized before database queries.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization
- Add SQL injection protection layers
- Validate all user inputs at API boundary
- Implement request payload size limits

### 11. Missing Authorization Checks
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CWE:** CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)

**Issue:** Inconsistent authorization implementation across API routes.

**Example:** Some routes check user role, others rely only on authentication.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement consistent authorization middleware
- Create role-based access control matrix
- Add resource-level authorization (user can only access own data)
- Implement principle of least privilege

## Medium Vulnerabilities (Risk: MEDIUM)

### 12. Insecure Security Headers Configuration
