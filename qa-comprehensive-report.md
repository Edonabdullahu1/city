## Conclusion

The Travel Agency application demonstrates a solid architectural foundation with comprehensive role-based functionality. However, significant quality assurance gaps exist, particularly in:

1. **System Reliability** - Server performance issues prevent proper testing
2. **Business Logic Validation** - Critical pricing and inventory management lacks coverage
3. **Mobile Experience** - Completely untested mobile functionality
4. **Error Resilience** - Insufficient error scenario coverage

**Recommendation:** Address the critical infrastructure issues before proceeding with production deployment. The application requires extensive additional testing to meet enterprise-level quality standards.
